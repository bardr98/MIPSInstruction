# MIPSInstruction
The code creates a user-friendly GUI tool that converts a MIPS instruction to its properties, such as opcode, funct, and format.
The tool displays the properties in an easy-to-read format for a selected instruction or a custom instruction entered by the user.
It uses a dictionary to store the instruction properties and string manipulation to display them.
